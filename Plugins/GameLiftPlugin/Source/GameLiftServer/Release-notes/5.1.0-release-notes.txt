- Add InitSDK() API with no parameters. This API reads server parameters from environment variables, such as fleet ID,
  compute name, WebSocket URL, process ID and auth token. This API simplifies SDK initialization in Amazon GameLift
  managed EC2 fleets. For initialization in Amazon GameLift Anywhere fleets, call InitSDK() with the ServerParameters parameter.
- Update ProcessReady() to retain a copy of FProcessParameters. This fixes segfaults that occur when Amazon GameLift C++ SDK 
  attempts to invoke user callbacks after FProcessParameters is freed in memory.
